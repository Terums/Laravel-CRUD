First is to Install laravel and composer to your device 
Also install the Node and NPM for better ui configurations
You can also install PHPMYADMIN and XAMPP for better Database configurations

Locate the  xampp\htdocs\
and dowload your folder in that location

Openb your IDE and open the folder

open terminal ctrl+`

make sure your on your current directory and type php artisan migrate

then you need to install laravel Breeze to generate user management
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
php artisan breeze:install
 
php artisan migrate
npm install
npm run dev

you might encounter UI ERROR and will show this on the upper part of the page @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
just go to resources/views/layouts app.blade.php 
and change the @vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js']) to <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}">
        <script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}" defer></script>
and do the same thing on this file  guest.blade.php on the same folder


Paste this on your routes/Web.php because when installing the breeze it can be reset your routing.
//securing the view for NON_AUTHORIZE logins
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function (){
    
    //routes all about task
    Route::get('/task', [TaskController::class, 'index'])->name('task.index'); //the route that shows all task
    Route::get('/task/new', [TaskController::class, 'newtask'])->name('task.newtask'); // route for generating new task
    Route::post('/task', [TaskController::class, 'store'])->name('task.store'); // route for storing or posting  the task in the db
    Route::get('/task/{tasks}/edit', [TaskController::class, 'edit'])->name('task.edit'); // getting the ID of the task on the DB and showing it
    Route::put('/task/{tasks}/update', [TaskController::class, 'update'])->name('task.update');// also based on ID and will update the data
    Route::delete('/task/{tasks}/delete', [TaskController::class, 'delete'])->name('task.delete');// deleteing the data
    

});

then also paste this on the upper part to connect the controller to route.

use App\Http\Controllers\TaskController;

and Thats it. open XAMPP then start the apache and MySql then click ADMIN on MySql
then you will find your database there named mywebapp which have different table like task, users etc... some of the table is automatically generated so dont be confused
